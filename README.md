AllColors - Backend üè≥Ô∏èüåà
Welcome to the backend service for AllColors, a vibrant, safe, and empowering creator platform built for the LGBTQ+ community and its allies. This repository contains the server-side logic, API endpoints, and database management for the application.

‚ú® About The Project
AllColors is designed to be a sanctuary where LGBTQ+ creators can share their work, connect with their audience, and build a sustainable income stream in a space that celebrates authenticity and safety above all else. This backend powers the core functionalities, from user authentication to content delivery and subscriptions.

Core Features
Secure Authentication: JWT-based authentication and authorization to protect user accounts and data.

Creator Profiles: Comprehensive profile management for creators, including bios, social links, pronouns, and custom cover images.

Subscription Management: Secure logic for handling creator subscriptions and unlocking exclusive content.

Post & Media Management: API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting image and video posts.

Interactive Feed: Endpoints to support features like likes, comments, and user suggestions.

Security-First: Middleware and best practices to protect against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, NoSQL injection, etc.).

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
This project is built with a modern, robust, and scalable stack:

Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.

Express.js: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data, posts, and more.

Mongoose: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For handling secure user sessions.

Bcrypt.js: For hashing user passwords.

Helmet.js: For securing Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

Express-mongo-sanitize: For sanitizing user-supplied data to prevent NoSQL injection.

CORS: For enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

Dotenv: For managing environment variables.

API Endpoints Overview
The API is structured around RESTful principles. Below is a high-level overview of the main resources.

# Method	Endpoint	Description	Access
POST	/api/v1/auth/register	Register a new user.	Public
POST	/api/v1/auth/login	Log in an existing user and get a JWT.	Public


üîê Security
Security is a top priority for AllColors. We have implemented several measures to ensure the platform is safe for everyone:

Password Hashing: All user passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored.

NoSQL Injection Prevention: User inputs are sanitized with express-mongo-sanitize to prevent malicious queries.

Secure HTTP Headers: Helmet.js is used to protect against common attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and click-jacking.

CORS: The API is configured to only accept requests from the approved frontend client URL.

Rate Limiting: (Optional but recommended) Implement a rate limiter like express-rate-limit to prevent brute-force attacks.
